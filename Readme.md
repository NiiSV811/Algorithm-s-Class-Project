This is my Class repo.
In This repository, I push mini projects about topics of the class.
I want to become a pro in FrontEnd... But at the moment i'm so newbie.
So, There's a lot of things that I could improve. :)

To start... I created a binary converter to a decimal numbers, I used my own function in JS.


P.D I'm learning English btw.
